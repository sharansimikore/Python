#The range function in python is used to generate sequence of numbers (n-1)
#We can also specify the start, stop and step-size as follow
# range(start, stop, step_size)


#1. range starts with 0
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

#2. range starts with 1    
# for i in range(1, 7):
#     print(i)


#3. range starts with 2 and with increment of 3
#By using step size a = 3

# for i in range(2, 10, 3):
#     print(i)
